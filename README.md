## Task Board
Our Task Board is being managed on Trello, ran by Callum.<br/>
[Link](https://trello.com/b/eeP74gVM/se-group-project)<br/>


## Current Task:  Sprint 1 - A to B
### Brief
See Trello Board for current User Stories in question.
Aim is to have:
- Core structure of App
- Integrate Google Maps API
- Stretch: Flesh app with textual in-app guides on how everything is going to work.


### Resources
- [Flutter Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutter_(software)) (See references too for those still trying to setup)
- [Flutter Unit Testing](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/unit/introduction)
- I can only recommend Googling the API or particular thing you want implement in Flutter/Dart.


### Deadlines
- Sprint Ending: 4th December
- Prototypes Completed: 18th December
